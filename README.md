# InstaPayX Java Payment System

## Overview

InstaPayX is a Java-based payment system designed to mimic the functionality of popular payment programs in Egypt. This project utilizes various design patterns such as Strategy, Template, and Factory, following SOLID principles and adhering to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) foundations. It is a direct implementation of springboot frame work for creating APIs

## Features

- **Payment Processing**: Simulates payment transactions similar to popular payment programs in Egypt.
- **Design Patterns**: Utilizes Strategy, Template, and Factory design patterns for a flexible and maintainable codebase.
- **SOLID Principles**: Adheres to SOLID principles for robust and scalable software design.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implements fundamental OOP concepts for code organization and readability.

## Design Patterns

### 1. Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern is employed to encapsulate algorithms for payment processing. By defining a family of algorithms and making them interchangeable, this pattern enables dynamic selection and modification of payment strategies without altering the client code.

### 2. Template Pattern

The Template pattern provides a skeleton for payment processing with specific steps that can be customized by subclasses. It allows for a consistent and extensible payment workflow while allowing certain steps to be overridden or extended as needed.

### 3. Factory Design Pattern

The Factory pattern is used to create instances of payment-related objects without specifying their exact classes. This promotes loose coupling, making it easy to introduce new payment methods or components without modifying existing code.

## SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles guide the software design to create maintainable, scalable, and adaptable systems. InstaPay adheres to the following SOLID principles:

- **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class has a single responsibility related to payment processing.
- **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: The code is open for extension but closed for modification, allowing for easy addition of new features without altering existing code.
- **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes (e.g., payment methods) can be substituted for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program.
- **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Interfaces are specific to the needs of the classes that implement them, preventing unnecessary dependencies.
- **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules (e.g., payment processors) do not depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Foundations

InstaPay follows key OOP principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to achieve a well-structured and modular codebase. Objects are designed to model real-world entities, and relationships between classes are established to promote code reusability and maintainability.
